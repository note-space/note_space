## note_space
A small PHP program to edit a collection of notes, and to organize those notes in the simplest possible way.
<br />
It runs on any Windows, Macintosh or Linux computer, but not on any smartphone.
<br />
The notes are saved in a sqlite file on the local computer; nothing is on the internet .. though you could put its files in a Dropbox (or similar) folder, to share between computers.
<br />
The download includes a small PHP "engine" for use on Windows; Macintosh has PHP built in, and Linux users can install it from repository.
<br />
Because the world is always in search of a new calculator, this program introduces a calculator that works within a block of text.
